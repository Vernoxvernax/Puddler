# eMPV (Emby-MPV)
Emby command line client using mpv, written in python.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vernoxvernax/empv.git
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python empv.py
```

Currently not a lot of features.

Playback using search-term and some ridiculous playlist mode.

More features to come.

Enjoy.

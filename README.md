### Latest update:

+ Linux and Windows support!! (kinda, on windows it spawns new mpv for every instance and get's stuck if you don't finish the video)
+ a lot of fixes
+ forgot the rest
+ ah, yes. the config files are now stored in the cache folder and not just the current dir

Currently, not a lot of features.

But at least both emby and jellyfin are supported.

Playback using search-term and some ridiculous playlist mode.

*More features to come.*

Enjoy.
